                <h3>Three things I have learned about myself and my ego from the core learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I think I have deepened my understanding of my erratic thought processes around the quality of work and comparing myself
                    with others, often looking at others work who have prior coding experience and comparing it to mine (in which prior
                    to this course, I had zero coding experience) and somewhat belittling or undermining myself and my work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    leading on from the first point, being able to identify when my self-conscious thoughts are bouncing all over the place
                    and taking a moment to reflect and rationalise these thoughts has been something I've further developed, in the case above
                    this would be seen as trying to remove my peers work from my mind and comparison all together and instead focusing on how 
                    far I've come and how much I have achieved in such a little time. In other words, comparing my past self with my current 
                    self instead of my peers with my current self.
                </p>
                <p>
                    something I've learned that is completely new rather than built upon a pre-existing foundation is the concepts around 
                    neuroplasticity and growth mindset. One thing I've specifically taken out of these teachings is the growth mindset idea 
                    of "not yet". This idea is something that I have thought about several times throughout dealing with challenging or troublesome 
                    code, which has helped me divert my thinking away from a concrete view of "this code doesn't work" towards "it doesn't work yet". 
                    This change in mindset often has acted as a mini energy booster, allowing me to push a little bit harder as in many situations, 
                    there has only been one small aspect of my code not working that retrospectively was quite an easy fix.
                </p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h3>
                <p>
                    I think that programming in general (and definitely my approach towards it) has strong collaboration elements to it,
                    whether that is working directly with others within your team to develop a specific application or through 
                    communicating and discussing with your client or boss about how an application should be made or its required features.
                    Because of this, there is a strong need for human interaction where I think understanding ones (and potentially others) values and having an
                    ability to empathise with them is vital in order to foster a projects success and ease in navigating its creation process.
                    I feel like some (and perhaps me to a degree at some point in time) view coding like some hacker sitting in the dark 
                    with five monitors furiously smashing their keyboard for hours on end when in reality, this is far from the truth. I believe
                    that self-awareness and the ability to reflect in contexts such as this are also vital, self-awareness being around
                    how effective a teams dynamics may be or how your approach to interactions and collaboration blends with someone else's. Reflection is also crucial 
                    so that one can look back and reevaluate all of the above in a context outside where it has been implemented.
                </p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">What has surprised me the most about the core learning</h3>
                <p>
                    If I had to sum up what I was surprised about core learning, I would say that I was surprised with how much I was surprised. Coming into
                    this course I had expected a lot of the core teachings to be around concepts that I was already relatively strong in and knew about, 
                    while this was true for much of the teachings, the number of things I didn't know, and more notable the amount of stuff I clearly needed 
                    reminding and reinforcing of were greater than expected and often allowed those concepts to be developed with greater understanding. some of these 
                    for example, were around mindfulness and aspects of the practice I had forgotten.
                </p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I wouldn't say a lot of the core learnings were challenging at all for me. If anything, I would say the research towards mindfulness 
                    was closest to this as my personal journey with mindfulness had definitely seen the definitition of what i conisder to be mindfulness
                    to somewhat warp around my personal use of it and my circumstances, taking a step back to reevaluate what mindfulness is truly defined
                    as meant that it had a certain degree of clashing with my own definition and perhaps required a little bit of overwriting.
                </p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">Why i think a programming school, is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h3>
                <p>
                    It is vital! It's virtually impossible to go about your work within a business without interacting with others, and the degree of technicality 
                    that comes with the role often means that these interactions and collaborations have to be well refined to ensure a whole party is on the same page.
                    Technical skills are much easier to develop than these core skills once in the job, so having a foundation of core skills gives an invaluable 
                    edge into the effectiveness of a team.
                </p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">Does the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practising programming instead?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not at all. As stated, I felt I had a relatively decent grasp on many of the emphasised core skills before coming into this course. Because of this, 
                    I undoubtedly knew the benefits and importance of having these skills within the workplace. These skills were also something I had been
                    developing throughout university, when working in groups with others who didn't necessarily have such a firm grasp on these skills, 
                    there was a clear impact on the flow of collaboration.</p>
