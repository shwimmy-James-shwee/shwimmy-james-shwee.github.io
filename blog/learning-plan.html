                <h3>Long-Term Goals</h3>
                <p>My long-term goal in a nutshell would be working in a personally enriching role with a company that cared about my personal development. By personally enriching 
                    I mean a job/role that worked towards delivering multiple types of projects, with a decent amount of variation, variation that would allow me to apply and learn 
                    skills in different contexts. The best example I could think of to help me explain my thinking would be along the lines of a consulting job, or working on 
                    projects alongside a project manager, one where I would have different challenges placed in front me, and more importantly one that didn’t have me heading into 
                    the office to compete the same work from 9-5 for 5 years. Personal development is another important factor for a career path, I want to know that through my time 
                    with a company I will be able to grow as a person for the better</p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">My View Towards How I Learn (Strengths/Limitation)</h3>
                <p>Discussed more in depth in my values, strengths, and limitations blog post, my strengths around learning would be my commitment to excel when I’m interested and 
                    engaged in what I’m doing. For example, I really enjoy creating my website and happily spend hours on end trying to get it closer to what I envision for it. On 
                    the other hand, tasks like “spend 10 hours learning HTML and CSS” present them selves as a massive daunting hill to climb and after several hours started to 
                    become tedious and less engaging. these scenarios are definitely less likely to produce work that I would consider I exceled at, yet I also have a strong 
                    commitment towards completing the work in the given time frame regardless (really driven by a deadline), just perhaps not to a standard as high as if I were 
                    engaged.</p>

                <p>Another skill I would say I have is knowing when to reach out for help. I am comfortable to research and perceiver for a while in an attempt to overcome what I’m 
                    stuck on but equally I have no trouble reaching out when that doesn’t produce any results, the way I see it is why would I spend two hours trying to overcome a 
                    problem if I can reach out to my peers/teaching staff and discuss the problem with them. In the worst-case scenario, I would do both, and conduct my research 
                    while I wait for a reply.</p>

                <p>One of my main limitations relates quite closely to the first strength I talked about. That being procrastination when I am not engaged and have deadline further 
                    away than the time it will take to complete the task. There is actually a term for this known as Parkinson’s law which states that the time to complete work 
                    expands to fill the time allotted. In my case however, when not engaged in the task, this rarely means it will be completed to a higher standard and instead 
                    incorporates more procrastination</p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">What Im Looking To Get Out Of The Course</h3>
                <p>Without patting myself on the back too much I would actually say that I am quite strong in the human skills front. I have always excelled in work when that 
                    includes working with others (evident through my feedback and grades from school and university), which was ultimately built off of my relatively extensive 
                    involvement in the performing arts through my later high school years. My family’s journey with mindfulness had also incorporated a decent amount of focus on 
                    emotional quotient (intelligence) which I think has been a great asset in this field. That being said these skills are ones of continual improvement with no 
                    limit so naturally I believe this will develop for the better throughout my time at EDA. If I was to give a specific skill however I would probably like to build 
                    on my presentation/public speaking abilities as I feel these have become a bit rusty recently.</p>

                <p>The main focus for myself at EDA is definitely the technical skills as from my experience my lack of experience within the tech sector (at the lower entry level 
                    end rather than my skills based on strategic and design studies) have been a limiting factor in my ability to find work, which is at the most basic level, is the 
                    reason I signed up to EDA.</p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">How I Will Manage Workload, And What Happens If I Can't</h3>
                <p>I think firstly it’s important to understand the weeks workload and plan my Monday to Friday in accordance with that, this naturally allows a buffer of the weekend 
                    if anything is taking longer than expected or I’m struggling with work. having a broken-down plan like this helps enforce a routine to ensure that I’m eating well, 
                    getting enough sleep, and ultimately have the best chance physically to work productively and safely. I also imagine, based on experience, that when bootcamp 
                    starts and we are on campus surrounded by like-minded individuals and ‘more direct’ or easily accessed support avenues that my main limitation of lack of 
                    engagement will diminish.</p>

                <p>At the point that I deem my workload to be building to more than I can handle then I will reach out within 24 hours of making that decision. If I decided the 
                    workload was building too much and I didn’t have access to speak in person (for example it was the weekend) then I would reach out via email. Preferably if 
                    circumstances allowed then I would meet in person either on the same day or next day so that a more thorough discussion of my work and workload can be discussed.</p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">What I Expect From The Team</h3>
                <p>At the point of reaching out I would expect compassion and understanding from the facilitation team if my work has been building up (assuming the explanation is 
                    reasonable), and more importantly would expect the focus of any discussion around the topic to steer towards how we move on from here, and how I can be supported. 
                    I would also expect follow ups over the weeks towards how a decided plan of action is working out and whether any further methods or plans to overcome the 
                    obstacle need to be put in place.</p>

                <h3 class="paragraph-gap">Commitments Outside EDA</h3>
                <p>I have no planned commitments that may clash with scheduling, however any unplanned activities that must be undertaken (such as bereavement or medical appointments) 
                    will be communicated on my part at the earliest I can. I would also expect support regarding catching up or structuring work around these commitments.</p>
