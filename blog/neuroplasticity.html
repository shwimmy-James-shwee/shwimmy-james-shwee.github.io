                <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                <h3>How Understanding Neuroplasticity Can Benefit People</h3>
                <p>There are many advantages of brain neuroplasticity for those that can understand and practice its principles, ultimately unlocking and allowing your brain to 
                    adapt, change, and be malleable to new information or teachings. As stated by 
                    <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Brain%20Plasticity,enhance%20your%20existing%20cognitive%20capabilities" target="_blank" style="color: white;">VeryWellMind</a>, 
                    being able to harness the power of neuroplasticity can help promote:</p>
                <ul style="font-family: Helvetica; color: white; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    <li>The ability to learn new things through allowing neural pathways to make new connections.</li>
                    <li>The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities through helping cement and reinforce those neural pathways.</li>
                    <li>Strengthening areas where functions are lost or in decline such as in the case of a traumatic brain injury or stroke by teaching the brain to rewire functions 
                        so a healthy section of the brain can compensate for the damaged part.</li>
                    <li>Improvements that can promote brain fitness and memory abilities.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="paragraph-top">How To Engage With And Increase Neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">PositivePsychology</a> have also recommended several ways in 
                    which neuroplasticity can be enhanced, these include:</p>
                <ul style="font-family: Helvetica; color: white; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    <li><b>Intermittent fasting:</b> by increasing synaptic adaptation, promoting neuron growth, and improving overall cognitive function.</li>
                    <li><b>Traveling:</b> by exposing your brain to novel stimuli and new environments your brain can open up new pathways and activity in the brain.</li>
                    <li><b>Using mnemonic devices:</b> memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss.</li>
                    <li><b>Learning an instrument:</b> which can increase connectivity between different brain regions and help form new neural networks.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-dominant hand exercises:</b> in order to form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons.</li>
                    <li><b>Reading fiction:</b> increases and enhances connectivity in the brain.</li>
                    <li><b>Expanding vocabulary:</b> which activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing.</li>
                    <li><b>Creating artwork:</b> can enhance the connectivity of the brain at rest, which can boost introspection, memory, empathy, attention, and focus.</li>
                    <li><b>Dancing </b>(my favourite)<b>:</b> reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s and increases neural connectivity.</li>
                    <li><b>Sleeping:</b> encourages learning retention via the growth of the dendritic spines which act as a connection between neurons and help transfer information 
                        across cells.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="paragraph-top">Growth Mindset</h2>
                <h3>What Is A Growth Mindset And Why Is It Relevant?</h3>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">"Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better?" - Carol Dweck, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Mindset</a></p>
                <p>Starting with the more traditional perspective on the mind (and the opposite to a growth mindset), a fixed mindset is a state of mind in which an individual deems 
                    there is no capability to improve and the knowledge that you have is finite and set in stone. People with a mindset like these tend to react negatively when faced 
                    with seemingly un-conquerable challenges as they perceive no potential avenue to overcome it, and ultimately tend to give up more easily rather than persevere. 
                    The opposite to this, which is closely aligned with neuroplasticity is a growth mindset, this mindset takes all these unfavourable characteristics of a fixed 
                    mindset and flips them on its head. This is a mindset in which one believes in themself and most importantly embraces the ability to change, learn, develop, and 
                    grow as a person. Like with many things having a growth mindset is not a simple yes or no question, rather more of continuum based on mental thought processes and 
                    more so how they translate into action. Assuming perfect alignment between an individual and the theories/concepts of a growth mindset one would face the same 
                    challenges deemed as un-conquerable by others with excitement and drive to utilise that challenge as a chance to improve and grow through hard work and practice.</p>
                <div class="about-me-insidegrid" style="gap: 2em;">
                    <div>
                        <p>Within the research world of the growth mindset, a large number of studies have been conducted within school students. From these it has been found (in accordance 
                            with information from <a href="https://mightifier.com/growth-mindset-why-it-is-important-right-now-and-how-to-best-promote-it/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Mightifier</a>) 
                            that the process in which fixed and growth mindset students process challenges is vastly different. Those with a fixed mindset were afraid to fail or make a 
                            mistake often meaning they would get scared to even try, as an opposite those with a growth mindset approached challenges as a natural part of learning and would 
                            attempt to process their mistakes and make correction.</p>
                        <p>Growth mindset has massive relevance to all regardless of age or occupation with learning and personal development being a never-ending process, there will always 
                            be new ways to work and interact in our quickly changing world and a growth mindset allows us to catch those changes as they’re thrown at us, put them in our back 
                            pocket, and run with them. Praise the process not the outcome.</p>

                <h2 class="paragraph-top">How These Will Affect Me and My Learning Journey</h2>
                <p>Personally, one of the most evident ways I have unknowingly taken a growth mindset-like approach during my time at EDA and throughout learning web development is 
                    by looking back on what I’ve achieved after each week. For example, after the second sprint on learning HTML and CSS I looked back at the website I had made and 
                    thought “wow, I couldn’t have done any of this a week ago, look how far I’ve come in just a week”. I believe that thought processes like this help me focus and 
                    continue my learning, knowing that the next week I’ll be learning JavaScript and then might be able to do even more cool things, and from that hopefully allow 
                    me to continue that pattern of continually trumping myself.</p>
                <p>Beyond the concept of a growth mindset, I think one element of the research for this blog post that will have a notable influence on me is the idea of “not yet” 
                    and its application around times I am stuck or facing a block in what I’m doing. At times like this when I may have spent over an hour trying to get a piece of 
                    code to work, and more so when this starts to frustrate me, I can reflect on the progress I’ve made and tell myself that while it doesn’t work, it more 
                    importantly doesn’t work “yet”. A change in language around how I speak to myself gives a subtle nudge to remind me that my code might not work now, but 
                    importantly doesn’t mean it won’t work in the future, especially with all the avenues for support I have around me.</p>
